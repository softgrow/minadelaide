#
# Convert 3ds to obj using Blender
#
# Run as follows:
#   blender -b dummy.blend -P bl_3ds2obj.py -- file.3ds ...
#
# dummy.blend is just an empty Blender file needed as an argument.
# Put one or more .3ds files on the end of the command.
# The .obj files will be created with the same name (and path) as
# the .3ds file, but with the .obj extension.
# The export creates a .mtl file for each .obj file also.
